# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Divine Orji

Iâ€™m a web developer with over three years of experience building clean, responsive web applications tailored to business needs. I have a passion for optimizing web performance and creating user-friendly designs that align with client goals.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working with a range of clientsâ€”from solo entrepreneurs to brands and start-upsâ€”both independently and as part of a team. One of my recent standout projects is the [Crunchies food ordering website](https://crunchiesonline.com), where I led the UI redesign and implemented features with **Next.js** and **Tailwind**. I also integrated a **Google Maps location feature**, allowing users to select their delivery location and find nearby outlets.
