### Hi 👋
My name is Divine Orji. I am a Software Engineer based in Nigeria.<br>

🔭 I’m currently working at TruParse with a team of developers to build products.

🌱 I'm also improving my skills on React, Node.js and TypeScript, and picking up other relevant skills I need to get my job done efficiently and on time.

📝 I sometimes write articles on [dpkreativ.hashnode.dev](https://dpkreativ.hashnode.dev).
